title: Skeleton Development
type: major
---

This is the first draft of a "plugin" page for Penrose, meaning a static
API to serve design, style, and substance file trios for a particular
domain (linear algebra in this case).

**Changes:**

* Jekyll skeleton template and theme developed, modified from penrose.github.io
* The user can distinguish the main docs from a plugin docs by the color (purple here)
* Repository structure modified to serve a static JSON API

**Remaining Work:**

* Need a cool 404 page
